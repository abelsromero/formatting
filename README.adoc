= Formatting test

== Steps

* Import project.
* Ensure the Spring Cloud Commercial is set up according to getting started.
* Ensure `Editorconfig` plugin is enabled.

* Format (cmd+alt+L) `RewriteResponseHeadersGatewayFilterFactoryTest`
* *Create PR with a branch with your name if there are changes, if not, comment on issue #.*


== Notes

* editorconfig seems responsible for aligning linebreaks after coma.
Without it, lines are shifted 1 indentation to the left.
